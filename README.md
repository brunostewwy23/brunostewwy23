# Hey, I'm Bruno Stewart 👋

**Backend Software Developer** | C# / .NET Enthusiast | Incoming Graduate Developer @ Mercedes-Benz 🚀

Software dev graduate passionate about building reliable, scalable backend systems. Currently leveling up my C# fundamentals through hands-on projects while gearing up for my grad developer role at Mercedes-Benz (starting soon!).

With a solid foundation in ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages, Blazor, Entity Framework Core, and a growing interest in clean architecture, APIs, authentication, and secure coding practices — plus 6 months of hands-on cybersecurity experience — I'm all about writing clean, testable code that solves real problems.

### 🔧 Tech Stack I Build With
- **Languages**: C# (primary), some Python/JS for scripting  
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core, Minimal APIs, Web API, Razor Pages, Blazor (Server)  
- **Data**: Entity Framework Core, SQL Server / PostgreSQL / SQLite  
- **Tools & Practices**: Git, Docker basics, xUnit / NUnit testing, Dependency Injection, RESTful design, JWT auth, FluentValidation  
- **Cybersec Lens**: Secure coding, basic vuln awareness, ethical hacking mindset from 6 months practical experience  
- **Currently Exploring**: Clean/Vertical Slice Architecture, MediatR, SignalR, .NET 9 features, unit/integration testing at scale  

### 🚀 Current Focus & Projects
Right now I'm laser-focused on **mastering C# fundamentals** through real projects (no more tutorial hell).  
Building muscle memory by shipping small-to-medium apps from scratch:  

- Personal Expense Tracker API (Identity + JWT, CRUD, reporting)  
- Blog/Content Management API with Razor frontend  
- Mini Vehicle Service Booking System (Mercedes-inspired domain: appointments, inventory, roles)  
- And more coming — check my pinned repos!  

Goal: Deliver clean, production-ready code that would feel at home in an enterprise environment like Mercedes-Benz mobility/tech platforms.

### 🌱 What I'm Up To
- Prepping for Mercedes-Benz grad program (excited to contribute to automotive software innovation!)  
- Daily coding drills: async patterns, LINQ mastery, pattern matching, records, source generators  
- Planning to add more tests, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), and maybe Docker-compose setups  
- Open to collab on .NET backend projects or cybersec-related tooling
